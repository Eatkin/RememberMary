Then what's left:
A trophy room that populates when you've completed or failed trials with trophies
Relevant events:
KilledSophie (for bad - knife trophy)
ReturnedPurse (and !KilledSophie for good - purse trophy)
RescuedDucks (good - duck trophy)
FailedRescue (bad - empty basket trophy)
SavedAbigail (good - cat head trophy)
DrownedAbigail (bad, pipe trophy)

If you collect ducks before talking to Topaz, you don't get the initial dialogue
Also: replacing the trophies causes them to become de-linked <--should be fixed
Also warn player they can't go back going through this door

A door in there that's only open when you've completed all trials
Then the final room which determines your ending

We don't go to the trophy room unless we've already done everything, then it's added as an 'inbetween' room
We view trophies and go through the open door which determines your ending

Endings:
Ending 1/3: Master of the Universe
You meet two masters of the Universe and they ask you to join them. You leave your body behind and fly to the stars
Mary
We are masters of the universe
You have done so much good in this world
Life doesn't seem good at times, but you make the best of it
Leave your body behind and come with us
Together we will show you the wonders of the stars
The wonders of the universe
Everything

(A transparent Mary descends from her body and flies to the sky with the masters of the Universe)

Ending 2/3: Mary's End
You meet a strange figure in the end room and they talk to you - across a table
They say they have bad news and that you drowned
Possibly have Mary's life flash before her eyes, random backgrounds draw and it shows a small animation of her growing from womb to what she is now
She says; so this is it? There's nothing I can do?
They say: I'm sorry Mary, there's nothing we can do.
Mary: This is the end?
Yep. You're dead.
(Instantly cut to credits)

Ending 3/3: Resurrection
Next level is your apartment, you can inspect things but Mary doesn't comment very positively on them
You go outside and stand on the balcony
If you interact with the edge she says "I miss my mum."
Cut to front view of her falling off the balcony
