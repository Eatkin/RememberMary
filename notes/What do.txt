Typewriter for choices using choiceFinished[0] and 1

Possible sounds:
Rumble in bad ending
Coughing in bad ending

Here's a text dump:
Warn mobile users graphics may be blurry due to resolution issues
Choices though - we need to add a button for one and two and set the choice box to display 1. and 2. instead of the usual

Also some things not to forget:
DON'T FORGET THESE THINGS:
An icon
don't say "Made in Gamemaker Studio 2"
Remember to include licence with source
Copy font to project
Options for win/linux etc
When you reset the game, reset the duck map as well!! (and list) and global.sins and global.virtues
Credits screen
Texture Pages

Little menu screen - browser and Win target are the same

So first - we have a start screen
It says "Mouse only mode (required for mobile devices)"
and "Full screen"
you click them or use keyboard/gamepad
i.e. if you move mouse, that takes over, but if you press up or down, that takes over
Will be the most annoying thing but oh well
