Remember texture pages for kitchen, garden, etc

Trim the house song (as in equaliser)

Explore themes of the seven deadly sins, i.e. this explores greed and envy

Outside:
Bullrushes - pointless interactable, but nice to have
The duck - needs feeds, then he will eat you

If you feed the duck, it grows and eat you
You can get sneezed out again by tickling the tonsils
In the duck there are three paths to take with different trials and puzzles, you have to get to the end and save the baby ducks
We can meet mama duck..a duck within a duck.
She asks you to save the ducks. You pick up the ducks like any other item. They thank you for saving them
Alternatively you may take a basket of duck plushies from a pressure plate which renders all the ducks inaccessible
The game warns you of the consequences:
"I could take this basket of duck plushies instead of rescuing the ducks. It looks like they're on a pressure plate that would leave the baby ducks inaccessible though"
"If I take the plushies, the baby ducks will die. Take the plushies?
>No way!
>Take plushies"

Instead of this, have a tap that you open to give you items, but it washes away the baby ducks

room like this:

The good:
"Thank you Mary, I don't know what I would do without my baby duckies."
The bad:
"What happened? These aren't my babies, this is a basket full of duck plushies."
"Why haven't you saved my babies? Why are you bringing me this?"
M: "There was an accident and now...it's impossible to save the ducks."
"No, that can't be right. My babies cannot be gone. They'll starve on their own."
"Mary, please, save my babies"
M: "I can't...but...I brought you these duck plushies?"

Aftermath:
Good:
"Thank you so much, Mary. I don't know how I can ever repay you."
Bad:
"I think you should leave and let me grieve in peace."

At polishing time, make the dialogue change subtley depending how many sins you've committed
I.e. the pot is like "A pot of stew for dinner", "Pot of stew" or just "Pot"
The wet patch can be like "A wet patch. My dad won't fix the leak" or later "Wet carpet. It's from a leak." and if you've commited all sins "It's wet."
Then also change Mary's animations and 2 or 3 sins, make her walk slower

Endings:
Ending 1/3: Master of the Universe
You meet two masters of the Universe and they ask you to join them. You leave your body behind and fly to the stars

Ending 2/3: Mary's Grave
You meet a strange figure in the end room and they talk to you
They say they have bad news and that you drowned
Mary denies it and says no, she's not ready, she has so much she still wants to do
They say: I'm sorry Mary, there's nothing I can do.
You're dead.

Ending 3/3: Resurrection
Next level is your apartment, you can inspect things but Mary doesn't comment very positively on them
You go outside and stand on the balcony
If you interact with the edge she says "I miss my mum. I'm going to try again."
