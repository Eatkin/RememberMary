Typewriter for choices using choiceFinished[0] and 1

Then what's left:
A trophy room that populates when you've completed or failed trials with trophies
Relevant events:
KilledSophie (for bad - knife trophy)
ReturnedPurse (and !KilledSophie for good - purse trophy)
RescuedDucks (good - duck trophy)
FailedRescue (bad - empty basket trophy)
SavedAbigail (good - cat head trophy)
DrownedAbigail (bad, pipe trophy)

If you collect ducks before talking to Topaz, you don't get the initial dialogue <-- Need to do this but it's really boring
Also: replacing the trophies causes them to become de-linked <--should be fixed
Also warn player they can't go back going through this door
^Finish this off- user events 0 and 1 need filling with dialogue

Ending 3/3: Resurrection
Next level is your apartment, you can inspect things but Mary doesn't comment very positively on them
You go outside and stand on the balcony
If you interact with the edge she says "I miss my mum."
Cut to front view of her falling off the balcony
Cut to black

Here's a text dump:
Detect if browser size is smaller than game size, if so we ask if it’s a mobile
If mobile, we need to resize ignoring orientation
Warn mobile users graphics may be blurry due to resolution issues
or clicking interactives, get the min box left between the obj and it’s linked instance
Oh don’t forget a way of continuing text boxes and making choices on mobile - just click
Choices though - we need to add a button for one and two and set the choice box to display 1. and 2. instead of the usual
Don’t forget to normalise mobile movement using arctan2
Also mouse only mode. And mobile has a spazzy thing where she’s oscillates so set a min distance between x and mouse x - the min dist will be Mary's speed

Also some things not to forget:
DON'T FORGET THESE THINGS:
An icon
don't say "Made in Gamemaker Studio 2"
Gamepad support
Remember to include licence with source
Copy font to project
Options for win/linux etc
When you reset the game, reset the duck map as well!! (and list) and global.sins and global.virtues
Credits screen
Texture Pages
Add alt interact keys
Allow gamepad to do all controls

Little menu screen - browser and Win target are the same
Option for MOUSE ONLY mode which will be default for mobile
Also WASD as alt controls
If it detects we are on a mobile, this is automatic <-- This is a bit of a problem, because tablets won't pick up the resolution thing so need to make sure they check mouse only mode
