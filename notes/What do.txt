BABY DUCKS
Need to be underneath Mary
Need to be destroyed upon interaction
Also little adjustment to the sins=2 dialogue for Topaz

Final trial:
The girl stuck in the hole is called Abigail
She has got stuck there and her child and bag with rescue rope is at the other side
You can turn on the water which will drown her, but raise platforms to get you to the other side
Or you can go through the maze and get her bag and rope to save her and her child
Additional lever logic:
-Alt dialogue if it's already been pulled

What I've done:
Giant Rock
Background

Wwhat to do:
Talk to the lady in the hole, you can drown her to get to the end of the maze
Otherwise you have to go pull two levers to get to the end, save the little girl and get a rope from the bag

Then what's left:
A trophy room that populates when you've completed or failed trials with trophies
A door in there that's only open when you've completed all trials
Then the final room which determines your ending

Endings:
Ending 1/3: Master of the Universe
You meet two masters of the Universe and they ask you to join them. You leave your body behind and fly to the stars
Mary
We are masters of the universe
You have done so much good in this world
Although life doesn't seem good at times
Leave your body behind and come with us
Together we will show you the wonders of the stars
The wonders of the universe
Everything there is to see
Everything there is to know
Everything

Ending 2/3: Mary's End
You meet a strange figure in the end room and they talk to you
They say they have bad news and that you drowned
Possibly have Mary's life flash before her eyes, random backgrounds draw and it shows a small animation of her growing from womb to what she is now
She says; so this is it? There's nothing I can do?
They say: I'm sorry Mary, there's nothing we can do.
Mary: This is the end?
Yep. You're dead.

Ending 3/3: Resurrection
Next level is your apartment, you can inspect things but Mary doesn't comment very positively on them
You go outside and stand on the balcony
If you interact with the edge she says "I miss my mum."
