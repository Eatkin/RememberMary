Let's look at the key points:
We want an ongoing theme of water, so maybe like a leak in Mary's bedroom, a pond with ducks in, go to the well to collect water etc
Also her dad is missing, away for work or something, so she talks about him in a negative tone
There is nobody in the town except Mary and her mother
her mother asks Mary to run some errands
Mary provides commentary
There is no way out of the small town (like palette town)

At some key moment, Mary gets pulled back into reality, but the player can mash keys or do some quick time events to prevent her from being pulled through
Her mother tells her "Don't worry, you've done enough" or something
She goes to her bedroom and meets some other world-ly figures who talk to her and tell her to go to bed
Fade to black

Alternative timeline of when you get pulled into reality:
She chokes awake and spits up water
Someone tells her she drowned but they've managed to save her
You spend some time in hospital for a conversation
Mary then has her final scene in her apartment, you may inspect things to find that she has no surviving family
Her dad was abusive etc
Once you have inspected everything, the game fades to black

I'm going to take a more surrealist take on the game:
You can meet a few people:
-Get pulled into the wardrobe by a tentacle
-Meet a duck who grows and you can go inside of
-Meet two masters of the universe

You deal with problems for them and the way you handle it determines if you get a bad or a good item; all good items gives you a good ending, Mary is at peace with her mother and meets the divine beings
All bad items gives you the bad ending, you get pulled out of the dream world and resurrected
Neutral just let's you go to bed and stays quiet
