Remember Mary is a narrative-driven surrealist adventure game.  

It follows Mary, a young girl in a world filled with her friends who she can help or hurt. Presented in squigglevision.  

I made it in about 9 days for the "I can't write but want to tell a story" jam.

## Source Code

Remember Mary is built using Gamemaker Studio 2. It was built quite a long time ago, and successive updates can affect things and create bugs and issues that didn't exist at the time of development.

### About the Code

Remember Mary's code is simple, but effective. Featuring a very modular dialogue system that I use throughout all of my games, and a simple bitmasking system to keep track of the player's behaviour throughout the game. This is used to measure a player's vices and virtues and alter game behaviour accordingly.
